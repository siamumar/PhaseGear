Welcome to the lucy-server Flask app. This is the web application you can run on your MySQL-equipped server to interface with the Lucy and Mood Reminder logging applications.

Server requirements:
-Python >=2.7
-MySQL >=5
-Flask (via pip install flask)
-Flask-MySQL (via pip install flask-mysql)
-MySQL-Python (via pip install mysql-python)
-Flask-CAS (via pip install flask-cas) (For user authentication against the university CAS server; this is optional)

To get the application running, after fulfilling the above requirements, fully fill out the configuration file config.py. You are then ready to deploy the application to the server of your choice.

This application has been tested successfully with an Amazon EC2 instance, though it should work on any Flask and MySQL-enabled platform (i.e. Google App Engine).
